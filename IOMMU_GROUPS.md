### Dealing with IOMMU groups
You can read about IOMMU groups [here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-iommu-deep-dive). To check your computer's IOMMU groups, use [this](https://gist.github.com/flungo/428c374c040de1d0a30fd4a593d39040) script, or [this](https://gist.github.com/r15ch13/ba2d738985fce8990a4e9f32d07c6ada) one which has a prettier output.

In my case:
```sh
$ ./iommu.sh
...
Group 14:       [10de:2757] [R] 01:00.0  VGA compatible controller                GN21-X11 [GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU]  
                [10de:22bb]     01:00.1  Audio device                             Device 22bb
...
```

The first device (`10de:2757`) is the actual GPU, while the second one (`10de:22bb`) is it's sound card. The hexadecimal numbers inside the square brackets (`[`/`]`) indicate the PCIe ID of the device. You'll need these for later.

#### Script alternative
You can also just use `lspci -vvnn` instead of the script. But the output is extremely verbose.

Example output:
```
...

       Kernel modules: snd_hda_intel
...
```

In this case, you want to look for `IOMMU group`. You can ignore the `<access denied>` parts, they're irrelevant.

IDs are on the first line:
```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GN21-X11 [GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU] [10de:2757]
                                                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^
01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:22bb] (rev a1)
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^
```

You can also easily filter and count the amount of devices in an IOMMU group. Here's an example command for IOMMU group 14. You can customize this according to your case.

```sh
lspci -vv | grep "IOMMU group: 14" | wc -l
```
```
2
```
#### Problems
Your hardware may be designed in a way that the IOMMU group that contains your dGPU may also contain other unrelated devices. This can make passthrough more difficult, **but not impossible**.

Fortunately, the PCI Express specification includes support for Access Control Services (*ACS*). ACS allows you to isolate your PCIe devices, breaking them up into multiple IOMMU groups.

To use ACS, you must use a special Linux kernel that has it enabled. The simplest solution is to just use a distro that comes with an ACS kernel by default - [Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org/). Nobara is a modified Fedora disto, that comes with some improvements, mainly for gaming, but regardless, it's just as usable as regular Fedora.

##### ⚠️ {WARNING} Installing Nobara alongside another distro
Nobara will likely overwrite your EFI partition, making it impossible to boot into another Linux install. You should install it onto a different SSD, or at least back up your current one with something like [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/).
